        <p>
          This website was created to help students and locals find the
          best dishes in Madison. Instead of just rating restaurants, Madison
          Bites focuses on specific dishes like the best sushi roll, the best
          latte, or the best bowl of ramen so people can get exactly what
          they’re craving.

        <p>
          The goal of this project is to build an easy, interactive platform where
          users can browse top-rated dishes, leave reviews, and help others
          discover great food around town.
